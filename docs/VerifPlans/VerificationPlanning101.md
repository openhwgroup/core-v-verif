# How to Write a Verification Plan (Testplan)
Verification plans are documents that defines _what_ is to be verified.  They go by many names including Testplan, DV plan or just Vplan.  A complete, high quality verification plan can be the most valuable item produced by a verification project.
## Format of a Verificaton Plan
CORE-V projects use spreadsheets to capture Testplans<sup>1</sup>. The template for the spreadsheet is simple enough that you can use either Microsoft Office Excel or LibreOffice Calc.  The Verification Plan [template](https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-docs/blob/master/verif/CV32E40P/VerificationPlan/CORE-V_VerifPlan_Template.xlsx) for the CV32E40P is located at the root of the [VerificationPlan](https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-docs/blob/master/verif/CV32E40P/VerificationPlan) directory.
## Verification Planning
A key activity of any verification effort is to capture a Verification Plan.  The purpose of a verification plan is to identify what features need to be verified; the success criteria of the feature and the coverage metrics for testing the feature.  Testplans also allow us to reason about the capabilities of the verification environment.

A Verification Plan should focus on the **_what_**, and not the **_how_** of verification.  When capturing a testplan we are mostly interested in creating a laundry list of thing to verify.  At this stage we are not (yet) concerned with how to verify them.

The “how” part is captured in the [Verification Strategy](https://core-v-docs-verif-strat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) document.  That document exists to support the Verification Plan. For example the CV32E40P testplan specifies that all RV32I instructions be generated and their results checked.  Obviously, the testbench needs to have these capabilities and its a goal of the Verification Strategy document to explain how that is done.
## A Trivial Example: the RV32I ADDI Instruction
Let's assume your task is to verify the CV32E40P's implementation of the RV32I ADDI instruction.  Simple right?  Create a simple assembler program with a few **_addi_** instructions check the results and we're done.  Of course, simply checking for the correct result (rd = rs1 + imm), of a few instructions is insufficent.  We also need to check:
* Overflow is detected and flagged correctly
* Underflow is detected and flagged correctly
* No instruction execution side-effects (e.g. unexpected GPR changes, unexpected condition codes)
* Program counter updates appropriately

Doing this exhaustively is impractical.  With one 32-bit and one 12-bit operand there are approximately 1.8\*10^13 unique sums that can be calculated. In [big-oh](https://rob-bell.net/2009/06/a-beginners-guide-to-big-o-notation/) notation that is O(13). Including the cross-products of source and destination register yields O(16) unique instructions simply to fully verify addi.  Obviously this is impractical and one of the things that makes Verification an art is determing the minimal amount of coverage to have confidence that a feature is sufficiently tested.  If we make a few simplifying assumptions we can reduce the problem to a managible size: for example we could say that addi is fully verified by covering the following cases:

* Use x0..x31 as rs1
* Use x0..x31 as rd (Note: the result of this operation will always be 0x00000000 when rd is x0)
* Set/Clear all bits of immediate
* Set/Clear all bits of rs1
* Set/Clear all bits of rd

It is the opinion of the author that the list above is sufficient for the addi instruction.  You may see it as overkill or underkill depending on your understanding of the micro-architecture or your level of risk adversion.

The key point is that taking the time to specify a Testplan for each feature in the device-under-test forces us to think about what the feature does, what we need to check to ensure its functions correctly and what stimulus and configuration needs to be covered to ensure the feature is tested under all penitent conditions.

The template used for this project attempts to provide an easy-to-use format to capture and review this information for every feature in the design.
## HOWTO: The CORE-V Verification Plan Template
The following sub-sections explain each of the columns in the [template spreadsheet](https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-docs/blob/master/verif/CV32E40P/VerificationPlan/CORE-V_VerifPlan_Template.xlsx).
### Requirement Location
This is a pointer to the source Requirements document of the Features in question.  It can be a standards document, such as the RISC-V ISA, or a micro-architecture specification.   The CV32E40P [introduction](https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-docs/blob/master/cores/cv32e40p/user_manual/source/intro.rst) lists sources of [documentation](https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-docs/blob/master/cores/cv32e40p/user_manual/source/intro.rst#standards-compliance) relevant to the CV32E40P.  _Every item in a Verification Plan must be attributed to one or more of these sources_.  Please also include a chapter or section number.  Note that if you are using the [CV32E40P User Manual](https://core-v-docs-verif-strat.readthedocs.io/projects/cv32e40p_um/en/latest/) as a reference, you **must** provide a release/version number as well since this document is currently in active development.
### Feature
The high-level feature you are trying to verify.  For example, RV32I Register-Immediate Instructions.  In some cases, it may be natural to use the section header name of the reference document.
### Sub-Feature
This is an optional, but often used column.  Using our previous examples, ADDI is a sub-feature of RV32I Register-Immediate Instructions.  If it makes sense to decompose the Feature into two or more sub-features, use this columnn for that.  If required, add a column for sub-sub-features. 
### Feature Description
A summary of what the features does.  It should be a _summary_, not a verbatium copy-n-paste from the Requirements Document.
### Verification Goals
A summary of what stimulus and/or configuration needs to be generated/checked/covered to ensue sufficient testing of the Feature.  Recall the example of the _addi_ instruction.   The verification goals of that feature are:
* Overflow is detected and flagged correctly
* Underflow is detected and flagged correctly
* No instruction execution side-effects (e.g. unexpected GPR changes, unexpected condition codes)
* Program counter updates appropriately
### Pass/Fail Criteria
Here we attempt to answer the question, "how will the testbench know the test passed?".  There are several methods that are typically used in CORE-V projects, and it is common to use more than one for a given item in a Verification Plan.
* **Self Checking**: A self-checking test-program encodes the correct result directly into the testcase and compares what the DUT does against this "known good" outcome.  See the [RISCY Testcases](https://core-v-docs-verif-strat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pulp_verif.html#ri5cy-testcases) section of the Verification Strategy for an example of this.  This strategy is used extensively by the RISC-V Foundation Compliance tests.
* **Signature Check**: This is a more sophisitcated form of a self checking test-program.  The results of the test are used to calculate a signature and this is compared against a "known good" signature.  This strategy is also used by the RISC-V Foundation Compliance tests.
* **Check against RM**: Here, the test-program does not "know" the correct output of the test.  Instead, the pass/fail criteria is determined by a **_Reference Model_** (RM).  An RM is a verification environment (testbench) component which models some or all of the DUT behavior.  The verification environment must compare the actual results from the DUT and the expected results from the RM.  When practical, this is the preferred approach because it makes testcase maintenance simplier.
* **Assertion Check**: Failure is detected by an assertion, typically coded in SVA.
* **Any/All**: Any (or all) of the above pass/fail criteria can be reasonably assumed to catch a non-compliance of a specific feature/requirement.
* **Other**: If one of the above Pass/Fail Criteria does not fit your needs, specify it here.
* **N/A**: Select this for those (rare) features in the specification do not have side effects that are observable in a functional simulation of an RTL model.
### Test Type
Choose one or more of the following:
* **RISC-V Compliance**: a self-checking ISA compliance testcase from the RISC-V Foundation.
* **OpenHW Compliance**: OpenHW Compliance is compliance testing of the custom XPULP instructions supported by CV32E40P.  For these we need to generate our own compliance test-suite.  It is not yet know if these can be randomly generated or will require a self-checking ISA compliance testcase from the OpenHW Group.  Note that if they are to be randomly generated then the ISS will need to be able to process XPULP instructions.
* **Directed Self-Checking**: a directed (non-random) self-checking testcase from the OpenHW Group that is not specifically targetting ISA compliance.
* **Directed Non-Self-Checking**: a directed (non-random) non-self-checking testcase from the OpenHW Group that is not specifically targetting ISA compliance.  Note that these tests assume that the pass/fail criteria will be "Check against ISS" (or other reference model).
* **Constrained-Random**: a constrained-random testcase.  Typically the stimulus for these will come from the Google random instruction stream generator.  Note that by defintion these tests cannot be self-checking.
* **ENV capability, not specific test**: Often, a specific feature is not specifically covered by a specific test or check.  For example, an assertion checking for bus protocol errors could reasonably expect to cause a failure with any type of test.
* **Other**: If one of the above Test Types does not fit your needs, specify it here.
### Coverage Method
How will we know that the Feature is verified (covered)?  There are several choices here:
* **Testcase:** if the testcase was run, the Feature was tested.
* **Functional Coverage:** the testbench supports SystemVerilog cover_groups that measures stimulus/configuration/response conditions to show that the Feature was tested.  **This is the perferred method of coverage.**
* **Assertion Coverage**: an alternate form of functional coverage, implemented as SVA cover properties.
* **Code Coverage:** the Feature is deemed to be tested when the specific conditions in the RTL have been exercised.
### Link to Coverage
This field is used to link the Feature to coverage data generated in Regression.  Leave this blank for now as this information is tool dependent.

<sup>1</sup>I know, I know, we _all_ hate spreadsheets, but they really are the best format for this type of data.

## Verification Plan Reviews
As core-v-verif is an open-source project it is necessary to enable open, comprehensive reviews with a broad set of stakeholders and interested parties in any proposed
Verification Plan.  At a minumum, design and verification leads, and related design engineers and verification engineers must be involved in a review.  The review should be
made open to all other interested contributors, utilizing collaboration tools as necessary.

Please use the following procedure when introducting a new verification plan or introducing a major edit to an existing Verification Plan.

1. The initial revision of the Verification Plan is created and added to the repository in a PR.  Note that the respective Verification Plan status page should always be up-to-date with current review status of the Vplan.
2. Create an Issue in core-v-verif https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-verif/issues/new/choose
   - The issue should be a Task
   - The issue should carry a core-specific label **if** the vplan is core-specific
   - The issue should have a link to the checked-in Vplan on GitHub.
   - The issue should be assigned to the Verification Plan Owner.
3. Arrange for a review call for the verification plan on Zoom, Teams or another appropriate platform.  Try to select a time to maximize attendance.
    - Add the following people as required attendees:
      - Verificaiton plan owner
      - Desiger responsbile for DUT feature being verified
      - Verification lead for project
4. Announce the verification plan review call and the Issue on Mattermost in the TWG: Verification channel.  Included a link to the meeting call.
5. Reviewers should pre-review the plan and provided comments in one of two ways.
    - (Preferable) directly annotate the spreadsheet via the comment mechanism in Excel and attach to the Issue when finished
    - Provided comments directly as comments on the GitHub issue
6. After the review meeting the Verification Plan Owner should incorporate feedback and apply a PR to update the plan.
7. Move the status in the README.md file accordingly to indiciate a reviewed plan

Note that a similar procedure should be followed for reviewing final vplan annotation after the vplan is fully executed.
