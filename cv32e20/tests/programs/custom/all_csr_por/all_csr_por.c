**
** Modeled CSR power-on-reset test:
**    Reads the CSRs modeled by the Imperas OVPsim Reference Model and prints
**    some useful (?) messages to stdout.  Will fail for one of two reasons:
**       1. Step-and-compare against RM mismatch.
**       2. read value does not match the documented PoR value.
**
** This is a manually written prototype of a (planned) generated test-program.
** The primary goals of this test-program is to get proof of life from all CV32E20
** CSRs and asertain the status of CSR modeling in the OVPsim Reference Model.
** In this prototype, all addresses and expected values are hand-coded.
