# Merge Test
Use this file to exercise the GitHub portions of the OpenHW Group workflow

Parts of the [OpenHW Group workflow](https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-docs/blob/master/verif/Common/OpenHWGroup_WorkFlow.pdf)
are modeled after Vincent Driessen's [git branching model](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).  When
you first register as a member of OpenHW, you can use this file to safely test whether you have the appropriate GitHub contributor priviledges for this repo.   Try this:
* Fork the repository: https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo
* Clone repository: `git clone https://github.com/[your_github_username]/core-v-verif`
* Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
* Commit your changes: `git commit -m 'Add some feature' -s`
* Push feature branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
* Submit a pull request

When all of that works, you are ready to make contributions to the OpenHW Group CORE-V projects.

If you are new to git, or unfamiliar with using branches and pull-requests, have a look at our [Git Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-verif/blob/master/GitCheats.txt).
