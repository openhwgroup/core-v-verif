# core-v-verif
Functional verification project for the CORE-V family of RISC-V cores.

## NEWS UPDATES:
**2021-07-15**: The verificaton environment for the [cv32e40s](https://github.com/openhwgroup/cv32e40s) is up and running.
<br>
**2021-03-23**: The verificaton environment for the [cv32e40x](https://github.com/openhwgroup/cv32e40x) is up and running.
<br>
**2020-12-16**: The [cv32e40p_v1.0.0](https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-verif/releases/tag/22dc5fc) of core-v-verif is released.
This tag clones the v1.0.0 release of the CV32E40P CORE-V core and will allow you to reproduce the verification environment as it existed at `RTL Freeze`.
<br>
More news is available in the [archive](https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-verif/blob/master/NEWS_ARCHIVE.md).

## Getting Started
First, have a look at the [OpenHW Group's website](https://www.openhwgroup.org) to learn a bit more about who we are and what we are doing.
<br>
For first time users of CORE-V-VERIF, the **Quick Start Guide** in the [CORE-V-VERIF Verification Strategy](https://core-v-docs-verif-strat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is the best place to start.

<!--
### Getting started with CV32E4\* cores
If you want to run a simulation there are two options:
1. To run the CORE testbench for the CV32E40P, go to `cv32e40p/sim/core` and read the README.
2. To run any of the CV32E4\* UVM environment go to `mk/uvmt` and read the README.

<!--
#### CV32E40P coverage data
The most recently published coverage report for the CV32E40P can be found [here](https://openhwgroup.github.io/core-v-verif/).
