# core-v-verif
Functional verification project for the CORE-V family of RISC-V cores. This project is under active development.

## NEWS UPDATES:
**2020-10-15**: Aldec's Riviera-PRO SystemVerilog simulator is now supported by core-v-verif.  Check out the README in [cv32/sim/uvmt_cv32](https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-verif/tree/master/cv32/sim/uvmt_cv32#running-the-environment-with-aldec-riviera-pro-riviera) for more information.
<br>
**2020-09-04**: a new (and _much_ better) method of specifying and organizating test-programs and simulations is now merged in.  See slide "_Test Specification Updates_" in the [2020-08-31 CV32E40P project update](https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-docs/blob/master/verif/MeetingPresentations/20200831-CV32E40P-ProjectScheduleUpdate.pptx).
<br>
**2020-06-12**: a new "Board Support Package" for CV32E40P simulations is installed at `cv32/bsp`.  This BSP should be used to compile/assemble your [test-programs](https://core-v-docs-verif-strat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/test_program_environment.html).  The Makefiles for both the CORE testbench and UVM verification environment have been updated to use this BSP.
<br>
**2020-06-02:** The [Imperas OVPsim Instruction Set Generator](http://www.ovpworld.org/) has been integrated into the UVM environment as the Referenece Model for the CV32E40(P).  You will need to obtain a license from Imperas to use it.
<br>
**2020-02-28:** The OpenHW Group CV32E40P is now live!<br>This repository no longer contains a local copy of the RTL.  The RTL is cloned from the appropriate [core-v-cores](https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-cores) repository as needed.  The specific branch and hash of the RTL is controlled by a set of variables in `cv32/sim/Common.mk`.

## Getting Started
First, have a look at the [OpenHW Group's website](https://www.openhwgroup.org) to learn a bit more about who we are and what we are doing.  

The design and verification documentation for the various CORE-V cores is located in the [OpenHW Group's CORE-V documentation repo](https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-docs).  Reading the [Verification Strategy](https://core-v-docs-verif-strat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is strongly recommended.

### With CV32E40P
If you want to run a simulation there are two options:
1. To run the CORE testbench, go to `cv32/sim/core` and read the README.
2. To run the CV32E40P UVM environment, go to `cv32/sim/uvmt_cv32` and read the README.

#### CV32E40P coverage data
The most recently published coverage report for the CV32E40P can be found [here](https://openhwgroup.github.io/core-v-verif/).

### With CVA6
To run CVA6 testbench, go to [cva6](cva6) directory and read the README.

## Directory Structure of this Repo
