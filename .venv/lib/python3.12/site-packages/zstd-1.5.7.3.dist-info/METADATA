Simple python bindings to Yann Collet ZSTD compression library.

**Zstd**, short for Zstandard, is a new lossless compression algorithm,
 which provides both good compression ratio *and* speed for your standard compression needs.
 "Standard" translates into everyday situations which neither look for highest possible ratio
 (which LZMA and ZPAQ cover) nor extreme speeds (which LZ4 covers).

It is provided as a BSD-license package, hosted on GitHub_.

.. _GitHub: https://github.com/facebook/zstd


WARNING!!!
----------

If you setup 1.0.0.99.1 version - remove it manualy to able to update.
PIP matching version strings not tuple of numbers.

Result generated by versions prior to 1.0.0.99.1 is not compatible with orignial Zstd
by any means. It generates custom header and can be read only by zstd python module.

As of 1.0.0.99.1 version it uses standard Zstd output, not modified.

To prevent data loss there is two functions now: ```compress_old``` and ```decompress_old```.
They are works just like in old versions prior to 1.0.0.99.1.

As of 1.1.4 version module build without them by default.

As of 1.3.4 version these functions are deprecated and will be removed in future releases.

As of 1.5.0 version these functions are removed.


DISCLAIMER
__________

These python bindings are kept simple and blunt.

Support of dictionaries and streaming is not planned.

Build from source
-----------------

You need module setuptools <72 to run tests:

    >>> $ pip install -U 'setuptools<72'

   >>> $ git clone https://github.com/sergey-dryabzhinsky/python-zstd
   >>> $ git submodule update --init
   >>> $ apt-get install python-dev python3-dev python-setuptools python3-setuptools
   >>> $ python setup.py build_ext clean
   >>> $ python3 setup.py build_ext clean

And you need to install `libzstd` developer files at least version *1.4.0*:

    >>> $ dnf install -y libzstd-devel
    # or
    >>> $ apt install -y libzstd-dev
    # or
    >>> $ apk add zstd-dev

or do manual installation of zstd from source.

And you need C99 support in compiler (gcc >= 4.8), libc >= 2.14.

Note: Zstd legacy format support disabled by default.
To build with Zstd legacy versions support - pass ``--legacy`` option to setup.py script:

   >>> $ python setup.py build_ext --legacy clean

When using a PEP 517 builder you can use ``ZSTD_LEGACY`` environment variable instead:

   >>> $ ZSTD_LEGACY=1 python -m build -w

Note: Python-Zstd legacy format support removed since 1.5.0.
If you need to convert old data - checkout 1.4.9.1 module version. Support of it disabled by default.
To build with python-zstd legacy format support (pre 1.1.2) - pass ``--pyzstd-legacy`` option to setup.py script:

   >>> $ python setup.py build_ext --pyzstd-legacy clean

But beware! Legacy formats support state is unknown in this case.
And if your version not equal with python-zstd - tests may not pass.

If you're scared of threads you may pass option `--libzstd-no-threads`:

   >>> $ python setup.py build_ext --libzstd-no-threads clean

When using a PEP 517 builder you can use ``ZSTD_THREADS`` environment variable instead:

   >>> $ ZSTD_THREADS=0 python -m build -w

If you're want to enable some speedup (maybe) you may try to enable built-in optimizations and pass option `--libzstd-use-asm`:

   >>> $ python setup.py build_ext --libzstd-use-asm clean

Or add more speed with option `--libzstd-use-asm-bmi2` to use instructions for new AMD CPU.
When using a PEP 517 builder you can use ``ZSTD_ASM`` environment variable instead:
And ``ZST_ASM_BMI2=1`` too for bmi2 use.

   >>> $ ZSTD_ASM=1 python -m build -w

If you want to build smaller module by size try to use option `--small`, but it will work slower.

   >>> $ python setup.py build_ext --small clean

When using a PEP 517 builder you can use ``ZSTD_SMALL`` environment variable instead:

   >>> $ ZSTD_SMALL=1 python -m build -w

If you want to build faster module try to use options `--speed3`, `--speed1`, `--speed2`, which corresponds with gcc options `-O3, -O1, -O2`.

   >>> $ python setup.py build_ext --speed1 clean

When using a PEP 517 builder you can use ``ZSTD_SPEED3`` (default), `ZSTD_SPEED1`, `ZSTD_SPEED2` environment variables instead:

   >>> $ ZSTD_SPEED2=1 python -m build -w

If you want to build even faster module try to use option `--speed-max`, but it will be optimized to your procesor only, similar to gcc options `-O3 -march=native`.

   >>> $ python setup.py build_ext --speed-max clean

When using a PEP 517 builder you can use ``ZSTD_SPEEDMAX`` environment variable instead:

   >>> $ ZSTD_SPEEDMAX=1 python -m build -w

If you want to build with existing distribution of libzstd just add ``--external`` option

   >>> $ python setup.py build_ext --external clean

When using a PEP 517 builder you can use ``ZSTD_EXTERNAL`` environment variable instead:

   >>> $ ZSTD_EXTERNAL=1 python -m build -w

If you want to build with a lot of debug output to stderr just add ``--debug`` option

   >>> $ python setup.py build_ext --debug clean

When using a PEP 517 builder you can use ``ZSTD_DEBUG`` environment variable instead:

   >>> $ ZSTD_DEBUG=1 python -m build -w

If you want to build with a lot more of debug output to stderr just add ``--debug-notice`` option

   >>> $ python setup.py build_ext --debug-notice clean

When using a PEP 517 builder you can use ``ZSTD_DEBUG_NOTICE`` environment variable instead:

   >>> $ ZSTD_DEBUG_NOTICE=1 python -m build -w

If you want to build with a lot more of debug output to stderr just add ``--debug-info`` option

   >>> $ python setup.py build_ext --debug-info clean

When using a PEP 517 builder you can use ``ZSTD_DEBUG_INFO`` environment variable instead:

   >>> $ ZSTD_DEBUG_INFO=1 python -m build -w

Some python builds need to force disabing LTO, so just add ``--force-no-lto`` option

   >>> $ python setup.py build_ext --force-no-lto clean

When using a PEP 517 builder you can use ``ZSTD_BUILD_NO_LTO`` environment variable instead:

   >>> $ ZSTD_BUILD_NO_LTO=1 python -m build -w

Some python builds need to force enabling stripping binary of the module, so just add ``--force-strip`` option

   >>> $ python setup.py build_ext --force-strip clean

When using a PEP 517 builder you can use ``ZSTD_BUILD_STRIP`` environment variable instead:

   >>> $ ZSTD_BUILD_STRIP=1 python -m build -w

If paths to header file ``zstd.h`` and libraries is uncommon - use common ``build`` params:
--libraries --include-dirs --library-dirs.

   >>> $ python setup.py build_ext --external --include-dirs /opt/zstd/usr/include --libraries zstd --library-dirs /opt/zstd/lib clean

But If you want to force build with bundled distribution of libzstd just add ``--
libzstd-bundled`` option

   >>> $ python setup.py build_ext --libzstd-bundled clean

When using a PEP 517 builder you can use ``ZSTD_BUNDLED`` environment variable instead:

   >>> $ ZSTD_BUNDLED=1 python -m build -w

If you want to check if build w/o any warnings just add ``--
all-warnings`` option

   >>> $ python setup.py build_ext --all-warnings clean

When using a PEP 517 builder you can use ``ZSTD_WARNINGS`` environment variable instead:

   >>> $ ZSTD_WARNINGS=1 python -m build -w

If you want to treat all warnings as errors just add ``--all-warnings-errors`` option

   >>> $ python setup.py build_ext --all-warnings-errors clean

When using a PEP 517 builder you can use ``ZSTD_WERRORS`` environment variable instead:

   >>> $ ZSTD_WERRORS=1 python -m build -w

When using a PEP 517 builder you can use ``ZSTD_FULLTIME_TESTS`` environment variable, to run tests with fulltime length:

   >>> $ ZSTD_FULLTIME_TESTS=1 python setup.py test

___

Module has simple API:

   >>> import zstd
   >>> dir(zstd)
   ['Error', 'ZSTD_compress', 'ZSTD_external', 'ZSTD_uncompress', 'ZSTD_version', 'ZSTD_version_number', '__doc__', '__file__', '__loader__', '__name__', '__package__', '__spec__', 'compress', 'decompress', 'dumps', 'loads', 'uncompress', 'version']
   >>> zstd.version()
   '1.5.1.0'
   >>> zstd.ZSTD_version()
   '1.5.1'
   >>> zstd.ZSTD_version_number()
   10501
   >>> zstd.ZSTD_external()
   0

In python2

   >>> data = "123456qwert"

In python3 use bytes

   >>> data = b"123456qwert"


   >>> cdata = zstd.compress(data, 1)
   >>> data == zstd.decompress(cdata)
   True
   >>> cdata_mt = zstd.compress(data, 1, 4)
   >>> cdata == cdata_mt
   True
   >>> data == zstd.decompress(cdata_mt)
   True
