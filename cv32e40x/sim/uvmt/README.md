Simulation Makefile Directory for CV32E40X UVM Verification Environment
==================================
This is the directory in which you should run all tests of the UVM environment.<br>
All results (compile logs, waveforms, run logs, simulation databases, etc.) will be placed in this directory under $(SIMULATOR)\_results<br>
For directory independent execution, please see the makeuvmt utility in the [$CORE_V_VERIF/bin](../../../bin) directory<br>

For information on invoking and controlling the UVM verification environment, see the [README in the $CORE_V_VERIF/mk directory](../../../mk)<br>
