description: >
  Standalone CSR read/write test for MSCRATCH (0x340).
  Tests full 32-bit write/read with deterministic patterns:
  reset value, basic patterns, walking ones/zeros, back-to-back writes,
  idempotent write, pseudo-random values.
  Macro-based design for simple R/W CSRs with no masking or constraints.
