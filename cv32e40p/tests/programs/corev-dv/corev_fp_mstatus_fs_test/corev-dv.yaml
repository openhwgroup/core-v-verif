# note:
  # 1) example yaml template for fp test with f_extension
  # 2) above setting running <n> streams with <m> rand instrs; +directed_instr_<idx>=<stream class>,<n>
  # 3) runcmd: make gen_corev-dv test TEST=corev_sanity_fp_instr_test USE_ISS=no CFG=pulp_fpu CFG_PLUSARGS="+UVM_VERBOSITY=UVM_DEBUG"
  # 4) [Must have plusarg]  enable_floating_point for extension f
  # 5) [Must have plusarg]  test_override_riscv_instr_stream=1
  #   - <value>==1: is to tune the streams not to overlap with other streams during streams placement
  # 6) [recomendation] for single directed_instr_<num==0>, try not to use apply too many streams else it might lead to placement issue
  # 7) [recomendation] no branch/jump for non-directed streams
  # 8) Must use together with test_cfg = floating_pt_instr_en OR floating_pt_zfinx_instr_en
